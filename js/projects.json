				These Häagen-Dazs units were developed as part of the larger <a href="http://soapbox5.com/timecapsule.php" target="_blank">E5 campaign</a>, encouraging users to write down their top five items in a five-year time capsule to promote the new <a href="http://www.haagendazs.com/products/five.aspx" target="_blank">Häagen-Dazs Five</a> ice cream. 

				I worked as the lead animator and developer on these ads at <a href="http://transistorstudios.com" target="_blank">Transistor Studios</a>. The animations were created using <a href="http://www.greensock.com/tweenlite/" target="_blank">TweenLite</a>, and the units were trafficked through <a href="http://www.pointroll.com/" target="_blank">PointRoll</a>."
